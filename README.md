# kicad-schema-parser

A lightweight LR(1) parser for KiCAD schematic dumps.

This project was never finished but feel free to contribute and I may continue working on it again. This was originally intended for a greater overall project of automatically generating rust for circuit boards I belive (creating this readme ~8 months after work stopped).
